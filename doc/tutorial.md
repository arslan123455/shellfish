# Tutorial

### Quickstart

I outline the simplest possible usage of Shellfish
[here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/quickstart.md).

### Toolset Description

A more complete description of the Shellfish toolset can be found
[here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/toolset.md).
It gives examples of how to generate a wide variety of useful catalogs in
Shellfish.

### Performance and Memory Restrictions

A detailed description of the resource requirements of Shellfish can be found
[here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/resources.md)

### Penna Coefficients

The mathematical form of the full 3D shell is described in depth
[here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/penna_coefficients.md).

### Contributing to Shellfish

Shellfish is an open source project and I'm more than happy to accept code contributions
and to give credit to any significant contributors.

An overview of adding code to Shellfish can be found [here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/code_overview.md).
It gives links to resources, goes over how to contribute your changes back to 
this repo. A qualitative description of the code structure of the Shellfish project
can be found [here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/outline.md).
(Note: this outline is under construction.)
