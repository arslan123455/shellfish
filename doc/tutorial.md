# Tutorial

### Walkthrough

A walkthrough of how to set up Shellfish and use it to create halo catalogs can
be found [here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/walkthrough.md).

The most complicated part of the set up procedure is describing what your internal
directory structure looks like in your configuration files. This step is described
[here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/walkthrough.md),
with examples.

### Advanced Topics

##### Resource Consumption (And Parallelism)

A detailed description of the resource requirements of Shellfish can be found
[here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/resources.md).

##### Manual ID selection

If you want to perform more fine-grained halo selection that what the `shellfish id`
mode does, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/manual_selection.md).

##### Using Unsupported Halo Catalogs and Merger Trees

If you are using a halo catalog or marger tree format that isn't supported by
Shellfish, you can get Shellfish to analyze your halos anyway by following the
instrucitons [here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/unsupported_catalogs.md)

##### Penna Coefficients

The mathematical form of the full 3D shell is described in depth [here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/doc/penna_coefficients.md)

##### Full Specifications for Each Mode
