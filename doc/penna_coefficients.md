# Penna Coefficients

Coming soon!

(As a holdover until I have time to write this section, an example of a function
evaluating a shell's radius at a particular 3D angle given a set of Penna
coefficients can be found [here](https://github.com/phil-mansfield/shellfish/blob/master/los/analyze/penna.go#L81).
The order of that input array is the same order as the output of `shellfish shell`,
so the code can be translated directly into your analysis code. I take the convention
that Theta is the poalr angle and phi is the azimuthal angle in that code snippet.)
